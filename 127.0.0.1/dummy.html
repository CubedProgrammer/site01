		<p class="subtitle">Dummy Nodes: The Better Way to Implement Linked Data Structures</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			We have all implemented linked data structures, where objects called nodes contain pointers to other nodes.
			Then, we would have the main container that points to a node or two in the entire structure, and we use those to access the entire rest of the structure.
			Each node would also store some piece of information that we call an element, and the structure stores the elements in a useful way.
			This is how most people are taught linked data structures like linked lists and binary trees.
			However, I would like to propose an alternate method different from the traditional textbook implementation of linked lists and binary trees, using a dummy node.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			The dummy node will be a node similar to all other nodes, except it only stores the pointers to other nodes, no data.
			We will see how to implement a doubly linked list using a dummy node, this idea easily transfers to other data structures.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			In a doubly linked list, each node has a pointer to the previous and next nodes, and so will the dummy node.
			The main container normally contains a pointer to the head and tail, instead, the dummy node will contain the head and tail.
			Specifically, the next pointer of the dummy node shall point to the head, and the previous pointer shall point to the tail.
			The head and tail node will no longer point to <span class="code">null</span> and will instead point to our dummy node.
			This makes the linked list circular, and will provide many benefits.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			One of the benefits is implementation simplicity, null checks can be safely eliminated.
		</p>
		<pre class="code">void insert_after(node*target, node*new)
{
	new-&#x3enext = target-&#x3enext;
	new-&#x3eprev = target;
	target-&#x3enext = new;
}</pre>
		<pre class="code">void remove(node*target)
{
	// sanity check more empty list has been omitted
	target-&#x3enext-&#x3eprev = target-&#x3eprev;
	target-&#x3eprev-&#x3enext = target-&#x3enext;
}</pre>
		<p class="paragraph">
			Another benefit is that in bidirectional reversal, you can reverse a finished iterator.
			If the head and tail point to null, there is no going back, all you have is a null pointer.
			However, by using a dummy node, the dummy node now represents a finished iterator, and iteration can reverse or even start again.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			Dummy node technique can be applied to other data structures, for singly linked lists, it would again be circular.
			Binary trees are a bit more complex, all child pointers to null shall point to the dummy node instead, and parent of the root node shall be the dummy node.
			The left child of the dummy node shall be the rightmost node, and the right child of the dummy node shall be the leftmost node.
			As there is one pointer left, the parent pointer of the dummy node now must point to the root, there must be a way to access the root.
			This ensures inorder traversal works, and after an iterator reaches the end, it can be reversed and restarted.
