You don't need to be like me, Lloyd. Your uncle has a plan for you, and even though it may be to stop me one day, we have to follow our own destiny.
- Episode 11, All of Nothing

Garmadon brings the underworld skeleton army to save the ninja, realizing even though he can help the ninja despite the Devourer's venom.

Because this time I will not fail.
- Episode 18, Child's Play

Don't you see? I will never do what's right. The evil in my blood can never go away. It has corrupted every ounce of my fiber, every bone in my body! I am Lord Garmadon! Destiny took my family from me, and the only way for us to be together is to turn everything in this world into my image. Then you'll all see what I see, feel what I feel!

- Episode 37, Versus
Garmadon's funny comment on how he betrayed Master Chen.

[Know] thy enemy, but more importantly, know thy friend.

- Episode 38, Versus
Lloyd excludes the other competitors to focus on saving Zane, Garmadon tells Lloyd that this can hurt their mission.

Control your fear. Don't let it control you.
- Episode 40, Spellbound

Chen grows strong by taking from others. But real power does the opposite. It empowers those around you. Like the way you've empowered me.
- Episode 41, The Forgotten Element
Yes.

Nya, it's karma. After personally destroying the biggest snake Ninjago has ever seen, it's only reasonable the second biggest would exact its revenge on me.

Yes.

[You] must not rest on your laurels, for your guard is down when you sleep.

- Episode 54, Curseworld, Part II
Garmadon convices Lloyd to destroy the Preeminent, and as a consequence, kill him. This is the second time Garmadon tells Lloyd to sacrifice him for the greater good.

- Episode 83, True Potential
Great villain line, Garmadon remarks about how the Oni masks only resurrected the evil part of him.

- Episode 86, Iron & Stone
Garmadon threatens to kill his subordinates should they fail him, he is just as merciless to his followers as he is to his enemies.

- Episode 88, How to Build A Dragon
Garmadon starts to telekinetically choke Harumi, despite the fact that she resurrected him.

When I had him beneath my foot, I could've crushed him. But I...hesitated. Ugh. You only resurrected the destructor. The Oni side of myself.
- Episode 90, Two Lies, One Truth
Garmadon questions his evil as he hesitated to kill his son.

- Episode 94, Green Destiny
Garmadon believes that power and strength is the most important.

Youthful ignorance! People don't change. They only reveal who they truly are!
- Episode 94, Green Destiny
Intended as an ironic line, Garmadon has changed from good to evil back to good and back to evil again, albeit magically. Alternatively, this quote can be interpreted to mean that once someone has appear to changed, they were always like that and were hiding who they truly are due to upbringing or societal pressure.

My power... where is it?
- Episode 94, Green Destiny
Garmadon loses his power, this line can be applied to when anyone powerful loses everything.

You still have to finish it!
- Episode 94, Green Destiny
Garmadon tells Lloyd to kill him for the third time, this time, not for the greater good, but because he believes the victor should kill the defeated.

It's not over. But when they come, it will be. My power... It was the only thing that could battle back the darkness from devouring us all. But you took that away. And now everything will be gone.... You'll see. And when they come, nothing will be left.
- Episode 94, Green Destiny
Garmadon refers to the darkness he told Harumi about in episode 90, Two Lies, One Truth, and how the ninja will not be able to stop this darkness.

- Episode 95, The Darkness Comes
Garmadon intends to help the ninja, and makes a passive-aggressive comment about how the ninja is no match for the Bringers of Doom.

The only way to defeat an Oni is with another Oni. You need me.
- Episode 95, The Darkness Comes.
Garmadon believes the Oni are the strongest beings in the sixteen realms, and only if he, an Oni, is by the ninja's side, do they stand a chance.

Hmm. That button should be labeled.
- Episode 96, Into the Breach
The way Garmadon says this so non-chalantly after they almost crash is hilarious.

Do they celebrate some conquest, or victory?
- Episode 96, Into the Breach
Garmadon sees pictures of the ninja, he thinks only conquest and victory matters.

Sentimentality is a weakness. If you wish to defeat the Oni, you would do well to banish such feelings.
- Episode 96, Into the Breach
Garmadon further explains his stance that feelings do not matter.

First, I am not a ninja. Second, I'm not a fool. And third, there are Oni out there, and we won't have a chance against them, if we're dragging a friend along like a human suitcase! So, you better decide, do you want to win or claim to your foolish ideals and perish?
- Episode 96, Into the Breach
Garmadon reinstates his stance on sentimentality, in this case he is correct.

Again, your sentiment clouds your judgement. The Realm Crystal is all that matters. Two of us stand a better chance of victory than one.
- Episode 96, Into the Breach
Garmadon again states that sentiment is weak after saving Lloyd's life.

Power before youth.
- Episode 96, Into the Breach

If anyone is going to destroy Ninjago, it'll be me, not some Oni usurper with a walking stick.

Every moment you delay risks our survival!

What could possibly be more important than survival?
- Episode 97, The Fall

Empathy comes from caring. So, he gave me something to care for.
- Episode 200, Christofern
Garmadon talks about the beginning of his journey to learn compassion.

She was like a daughter to me. Smart. Ruthless. Brutal. And yet, I cannot help others until I have found myself. My true self.
- Episode 200, Christofern
Garmadon still considers Harumi his daughter, and declares his intention to find his redemption.

I have taken a vow of nonviolence. A farewell to arms, you might say.... Christofern!
- Episode 200, Christofern
Garmadon breaks his vow of non-violence immediately after saying that, and then seeing Christofern damaged by an explosion in the invasion of Ninjago City, and goes full Oni to attack the Crystal Warriors. He is also making a pun here, arms referring to weapons, but also two of his arms that he has shapeshifted away.

I understand your mistrust. But I have changed since last we met. And I shall do my best to be a kind and patient teacher to Lloyd.
- Episode 201, A Lesson In Anger
Garmadon tells the ninja about how he has changed, as to the last part. He instantly starts to yell at Lloyd as Lloyd is unable to enter his Oni form. Which he believes is the only thing that can destroy the Overlord.

No, no, no! Terrible times infinity! I would have an easier time teaching dogs how to speak! I've been to the Realm of Madness, the Underworld, the Cursed, the Departed Realm. But I have never found myself in a situation more hopeless than this! It's like you want Ninjago to fall to the Overlord! Harumi would at least have understood what I was getting at!
- Episode 201, A Lesson In Anger
Garmadon has a clever idea to get Lloyd to unlock his Oni form, by yelling at him until he is so angry that he transforms, and it worked.

It was the only green in my life. I had hoped it would grow, and thrive, and perhaps, one day ... forgive me. But now it's gone, and I am alone.
- Episode 202, Brave but Foolish
Garmadon is sad that Christofern is dead, but Nya tells him otherwise.

I suppose. But now it's like ... if I were in his position, I would want to ... not be destroyed? Or something? I don't know. Whatever. Let's go.
- Episode 207, Distress Calls
Garmadon is learning compassion.

How can they not trust me?!
- Episode 208, An Issue of Trust
Garmadon is confused as to why the ninja do not trust him, the ninja are still harbouring old grudges despite Garmadon clearly being on their side.

Save ... Save yourself. It's too late for me.
- Episode 210, Roots
Garmadon fakes his own death as a last ditch attempt to get Lloyd to go into his Oni form to destroy the Overlord, it works, Lloyd fully completes the transformation and unleashes his full anger at the Overlord, but quickly snaps out of it. There are many things wrong with the ending, but this document is not about the ending.

It's true. She helped. Not as much as I did, perhaps, but why argue over details.
- Episode 210, Roots
Garmadon makes a remark about how he helped more than Harumi did.

I once thought roots were a sign of weakness. Hmm. But I was wrong. We are stronger together. I must go help my son rebuild his monastery now. Hmm. An Oni, building instead of destroying. What next? What next indeed.
- Episode 210, Roots
Garmadon has become good and remarks how incredible it is that an Oni has turned good.
