			<p id="overview" class="subtitle">Overview</p>
			<p>A major issue is that the ending is very rushed, we have not even gotten to seen all of the sixteen realms yet, the ending is too early. Not only that, this season was very rushed, the Overlord returns half way through, attacks, and just gets defeated. The side plots of returning allies and Lloyd's Oni arc did not get enough time to develop. This season should have been sixty episodes.</p>
			<p>The characters do not act like they should, especially Lloyd and Harumi, Lloyd's actions are not even consistent between consecutive episodes.</p>
			<p>This season also continues the trend of lack of lasting consequences. Nya is resurrected, but loses her powers, which could have been a good consequence, but that was also reverted.</p>
			<p>A lot of details from previous seasons simply gets forgotten or are incorrectly referenced, many examples will be listed below. I believe some of the writers did not even watch the previous seasons.</p>
			<p id="e181" class="subtitle">181. Farewell the Sea</p>
			<p>The ninja are split up again after losing someone, this would not be an issue if it was not simply a repeat of season 4.</p>
			<p id="e182" class="subtitle">182. The Call of Home</p>
			<p>The first hint that Nya is going to return is in this episode, when Nya talks to Nyad and finds that if she loses her power, she can return. Nya returning would be okay if it was not so soon.</p>
			<p id="e183" class="subtitle">183. The Shape of Nya</p>
			<p>The ninja are rusty and out of shape again, a repeat of season 11. Not that bad on its own but this season is full of empty nostalgia bait and fan service.</p>
