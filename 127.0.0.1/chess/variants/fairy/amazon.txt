Amazon
The amazon is a fairy chess piece that combines the moves of a rook, bishop, and knight. When placed in the center of the board, it can control more than half the squares on the board. It can also deliver checkmate without assistance.

The amazon is typically represented using a capital A in algebraic notation, and represented using a kinght with a queen crown on its head as a picture.
#Strength
The amazon is much stronger than having a rook, bishop, and knight separate. It is estimated to be worth 13 pawns, more than a queen and a knight. The amazon can be used to fork pieces in sixteen different directions, much better than a queen.
The amazon enables more checkmate patterns, a king on the edge will be mated by an amazon if it is a knight's move apart, or two squares apart orthogonally, it will also be mated if it is two squares apart diagonally and in a corner.
